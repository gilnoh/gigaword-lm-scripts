(devel Memo for PPL runner scripts. permanent memos should go to memo.org ) 

** DONE clean condprob code
 
** DONE finish multiple sentence PPL checking (lost code) 

** DONE work on ppl_t and ppl_h_given_t 
*** result is now as condprob_h_given_h 
-  [writing on condprob.pm] PPL oriented P(b|a) 
*** PPL_X(text, context) needs to return 
- length of the text: two numbers: count nonOOV words, count sentence. 
- probability: P_col(text), P_model(text), P_model(text | context) 
- Maybe also ppl? but this can be easily get by calc_ppl(logprob, nonOOV, count_sent). 
- well, but maybe: PPL_col (text), PPL_model(text), PPL_conditioned_model(text | context)  


** DONE check new method works Okay 
- compare same sentence with old method. write down output values and check the same. 
- also check the collection value output is the same, with SRILM value. 

** TODO work on PPL runner 
*** DONE main outline 
*** TODO continue work on ppl_one_doc 
*** TODO expand it to work on multiple files (files in dir) 

** PPL runner systemically 


* SOME checks to run 
** Sanity check of PPL sum on document level. 
*** TODO compare PPL sum of collection over the sentences and ngram ppl output itself. 
- when PPL_X(text,context) is completed with its PPL for the doc. 


* ppl_sum: the equation: of getting multiple per-word-ppl of sentences to get per-word-ppl of the doc. 
- equation 
10^SUM where SUM is:  
(part_a_len  / total_len) * log10 ppl_a + ... + (part_n_len / total_len) * log10 ppl_n 
- note that it is base10, due to the fact we are using SRILM based numbers. 
- note really needed... just sum logprob, and calc_ppl(logprob, countNonOOV, countSent)


* Different way of giving context 
- just previous sentence 
- all previous sentences 
- previous two sentences 
- prev+3, next+3 sentences 
- all other sentences within document (other than this)
