(Memo for PPL runner scripts) 

** TODO clean condprob code 
** TODO finish multiple sentence PPL checking (lost code) 

various test scripts for PPL checking ... and design/test memos

* SOME checks to run 
** Sanity check of PPL sum equation. 
*** TODO compare PPL sum of collection over the sentences and ngram ppl output itself. 
- when PPL_X(text,context) is completed with its PPL for the doc. 

* [writing on proto_prob) PPL oriented P(b|a) 
** each PPL_X(text, context) needs to return 
- length of the text: two numbers: count nonOOV words, count sentence
- (per-word) PPL of the text: three numbers: collection_ppl, P(text) ppl, P(text | context) ppl. 
- (well, this is the actual value, so why not?) logprobs: three numbers: P_coll(text), P(text), P(t|c)
*** TODO write PPL_calc
- copy P_h_give_t_index, tune it for this. 
*** TODO write PPL_sum 
- as you see in the equation.

* ppl_sum: the equation: of getting multiple per-word-ppl of sentences to get per-word-ppl of the doc. 
- equation 
10^SUM where SUM is:  
(part_a_len  / total_len) * log10 ppl_a + ... + (part_n_len / total_len) * log10 ppl_n 
- note that it is base10, due to the fact we are using SRILM based numbers. 

* Different way of giving context 
- just previous sentence 
- all previous sentences 
- previous two sentences 
- prev+3, next+3 sentences 
- all other sentences within document (other than this)
