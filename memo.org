* why it works? 

** Lexical level co-occurrence can't answer P(h|t)

Sentence as sum of lexicals. 

*** Example 1
- Hidelberg castle 
- "... was destryed in XX" 

Can you find the "..." from search "Heidelberg", or "Castle?" 

*** Example 2
- Boeing Headquator, Boeing factory, Boeing wing assembly for 777 
- located in Seattle, in Oclahoma, in Japan, Yokohama, 

Word-level "relatedness" can't answer much. But the approach can. 

"Boeing HQ" -> 
"Boeing factory" -> 
"Boeing 777 wing assembly" -> 

* Weakness? 

** One easy way to fool it. 
- Greb one news, twist something in T to make it the opposite. (still
  highly similar).  Give a sentence as H, extracted from the same
  doc.( But do we want this? TE is to answer "real-world". so no, I
  guess. ) 

- More likely: one additional "Explanatory" sentences;
  cases. #596 #593. Almost impossible for this approach to solve.
