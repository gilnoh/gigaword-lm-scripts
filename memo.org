* Splitta bug(?) 

- somehow it generates some strange outputs. 
- The following two cases are being patched after Splitta work. 
- (From gigaword_split_file.pl) 
    # fixing tokenization error of Splitta (the end of sentence) 
    # case 1) Period (\w.$) at the end  -> (\w .$) 
    s/\.$/ \. /; 
    # case 2) Period space quote (\w. " $) at the end. -> (\w . " $) 
    s/\. " $/ \. " /;

- Note that new inputs should go through the same process.
