* Design of simple, linear-interpolated Multivariate Bernoulli

** Basic equation 
- PI_for_all_terms ( lambda x P_doc("term") + (1-lambda) x P_coll("term") )

*** P_doc("term") 
- 1 if the doc includes the term.  
- 0 if the doc does not have that. 

*** P_coll("term") 
- MLE; that is, count(num of doc with term) / count all docs

*** Excluded terms 
- All stop words simply are excluded from the calculation. 
- All OOV words are also simply excluded from the calculation. 

*** MAYBE? 
- term can be extended to other features, such as bi-gram, and so on
  ... 

** Implementation (own) 
Big Inverted index of all n-grams. "n-gram" queried, all document ids
returned.
(this would be big. so let's just do with upto-trigram only... hmm.) 

Okay, suppose you have this table. 

find("gram") : outputs "doc_id:count", "doc_id:count" ... 


*** Index structure 

* Splitta bug(?) 

- somehow it generates some strange outputs. 
- The following two cases are being patched after Splitta work. 
- (From gigaword_split_file.pl) 
    # fixing tokenization error of Splitta (the end of sentence) 
    # case 1) Period (\w.$) at the end  -> (\w .$) 
    s/\.$/ \. /; 
    # case 2) Period space quote (\w. " $) at the end. -> (\w . " $) 
    s/\. " $/ \. " /;

- Note that new inputs should go through the same process.
