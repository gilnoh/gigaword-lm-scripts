* List of Things to Fix 
** TODO [#A] bug splitta outputs the last "." concatted to the last Word.    
** TODO [#C] feature catall.pl "do not print a file size less than X" 

* Status Memo 
** Current corpus: 
- AFP 2010, as "small" test. 

==== 

* Things to Do 
** Collection Model 

*** DONE (run) Get "target" news files (target corpus) all in one folder 
*** DONE (run) catall and generate collection LM model 

** Document Model 
*** TODO (write script) For each file, make each LM model

** Produce single sentence prob. (t) 
*** TODO (write matlab script) weighted-sum 
- input: weight (doc prob), sentence prob, of each document 
- output: weighted average. 
- 

*** TODO (write scripts) P(t) prob 
(Perl side) 
- get P_coll (t) (with -debug 3)
- get for each pure P_d(t) (with -debug 3), on all doc 
- calculate lamda*P_d + (1-lamda)*P_coll for each. (octave? perl?) 
(Octave side) 
- do the weighted-sum of the values, with uniform weight 
- (need): weighted-sum input format (simple matrix)
- (need): weighted-sum matlab code 
(Perl side?) 
- store the result for each P_d(t). 
- store the one reulst P(t). 

** Produce conditional prob. 
*** TODO (write scripts) P(h | t) prob 
(perl side) 
- get P(h), using previous section 
- get P_d(t) for each doc. 
(Octave side) 
- do the weighted-sum of the P_d(h) values, with (P_d(t) /
  sigma(P_d(t))) as weight for each d. 

*** TODO write script "evidence calculation code"

* call parameters 


* Additional notes 
- "-bayes 0" mix-model is generally what I would expect from simple
  summation: simple (lambda * model 1 prob) + ((1-lamba) * model 2
  prob), for each word point. (Well if you ask me what -bayes non-zero
  means ... I don't) 
- (like parameters)
