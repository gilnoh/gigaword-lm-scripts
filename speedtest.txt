==== 
Some more test --- indexed (cz random access test?) case without reordering 
On this result gillespie is so very slow! (x10 times). 
Why? --- "random access?", or "i-node order access"? 

(Westy on 2009 + 2010 AFP data, approximated with top 1000 hits)

====
Some more test --- indexed case *with* reordering (alphabetic order) 

(Westy 09+10) 2 threads (uganda example) 
without reordering: 684 sec 
with reordering: 663 sec 
(-20 seconds. hmm. not bad, but somethign else is in problem. I suppose.)
