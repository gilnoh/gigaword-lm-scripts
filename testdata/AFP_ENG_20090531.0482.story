football : we 'll be back vows moyes after cup final heartache

david moyes insists everton must use the pain of their fa cup final defeat against chelsea as motivation for success next season . 

moyes ' side were unable to take silverware back to goodison park for the first time in 14 years despite the boost of louis saha 's record-breaking first minute strike at wembley on saturday . 

saha gave everton a shock lead just 25 seconds after kick-off , claiming the record for the fastest ever fa cup final goal in the process . 

but even that did n't shake chelsea out of their stride . 
guus hiddink 's team methodically worked their way back into the game and equalised through didier drogba before frank lampard drove home the second half winner . 

moyes cut a dignified figure after the match as he insisted chelsea were deserved winners , but deep down the blues boss was feeling the pain more than anyone . 

he knew how significant a cup final victory would have been in his attempt to establish everton as a major threat to the premier league 's big four . 

but the numbing sense of a missed opportunity could n't totally dampen moyes ' desire to emphasise that everton are still within touching distance of success . 

" i said last year when we got the league cup semi-final and lost to chelsea that the next step was to get to a final . 
well , we 've got to a final beating manchester united , liverpool and aston villa on the way , " moyes said . 

" the next bit will hopefully come next year and we 'll win a cup . 

" we know it 's really hard to win things in england , with so many teams fighting for just a few prizes . 

" but for us to finish fifth and reach the fa cup final , then come here and not look out of place was a great achievement . 
we played chelsea twice this season and drew and this was only 2-1 . 

" i 'm really keen that the players are recognised for how well they have done this season because they have been outstanding . " 

while moyes rightly takes great heart from his team 's achievements , he knows it will take a stronger squad to make the transistion from nearly-men to big-game winners . 

injuries to spanish midfielder mikel arteta , nigeria forward ayegbeni yakubu and defender phil jagielka deprieved everton of three key figures for the second half of the season and moyes concedes that left his side short of the quality needed to live with chelsea . 

" if chelsea had gone into this game without lampard and drogba it would have given us a better chance . 
and we went in with jagielka , yakubu and arteta . 
they are the equivalent players for us as those chelsea players , " moyes said . 

" players like drogba , lampard and ( john ) terry are the people who win you cups . 
that is the level we are at . 

" we are trying to develop those players . 
we have one or two who are coming on . 
i thought steven pienaar was outstanding . 
we just need a few more at that level and then who knows . "
