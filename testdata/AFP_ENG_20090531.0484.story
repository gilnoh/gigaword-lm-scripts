football : rangers on holiday , happy with domestic double

rangers assistant manager ally mccoist said he was looking forward to his summer break after a nacho novo wonder strike won the scottish cup as the gers secured a domestic double . 

the ibrox side 's narrow 1-0 victory over a battling falkirk side means rangers can add the scottish cup to the scottish premier league championship they won on the final day of the season . 

it brings to a close a long season for the ibrox side which begun with a champions league qualifier against fbk kaunas on july 30 last year . 

the glasgow giants , who the season before had reached the uefa cup final , suffered a painful elimination from europe at the hands of the lithuanian minnows . 

and while mccoist says the club will look to buy more players in the summer , the fact they put the disappointment of the kaunas defeat behind them to secure a league and cup double was testament to the effort the players had put in since he and walter smith returned to the club in january 2007 . 

" it can always get better in terms of the team and the squad . 
with a bit of luck we can maybe add to that and look to strengthen , " mccoist said . 

" but in terms of what the boys achieved in the last two years the team deserve all the credit going . 

" last year was so close to being the best season in the club 's history . 
it ended up being , in many people 's eyes , a disappointment when we lost the league on the final day . 

" we can sit and talk about it all day if we deserved or we did n't deserve it . 
the fact is we did n't win it . 

" i just felt that this year it was a real reward for the players . " 

mccoist added : " i am absolutely looking forward to my break like you have no idea . 
i 've got the golf clubs looked out and hopefully i 'll take a few quid off the manager in the summer . 

" i think the players will be looking forward to getting away from us more but they really need a break , especially with last season when they did n't get as much of a break as we would 've liked . " 

mccoist also heaped praise on striker novo , who scored 36 seconds after coming off the bench at half-time . 

the spaniard collected a sasa papac throw-in to send a sensational strike past falkirk keeper dani mello from 30 yards out as the ibrox side lifted the scottish cup for the 33rd time . 

and mccoist , himself a legendary striker with the gers , said it was a goal worthy of winning any cup final . 

" it was very good . 
looking at the context of the game and the quality of the goal it will take some beating , " mccoist said . 
" it 's certainly one of the great goals to win any cup final in any country i would think . 

" i can still see it . 
i was actually praying he would hit it as he got himself that wee half yard in front and i thought , just have a hit and see what happens , and i knew it would be close . 

" nacho is just an incredible wee guy . 
he 's got a wonderful rapport with the fans and the rest of the squad . 

" he deserves his success because he works so hard every day in training . 

" anywhere lights up when the wee fellow walks in , whether it 's onto a football park or into a room , heâ€˜s just that kind of person . 

" if anyone deserves the success it 's him as it 's not easy when you 're on the bench . " 

and after securing his fourth double while in charge of the glasgow giants manager walter smith said he would be in charge next season to collect more trophies , despite speculation to the contrary . 

" certainly in glasgow you are surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of rumours . 
you obviously just have to wait and see what happens , " smith said . 

" going upstairs today ( to collect the scottish cup ) is the kind of thing i wanted to do when i came back to rangers . 

" they are the kind of stairs i want to walk up . 
that 's why i came back . "
