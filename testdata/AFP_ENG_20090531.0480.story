football : cup final hero lampard salutes hiddink

frank lampard described guus hiddink as managerial genius after the dutchman guided chelsea to victory in the fa cup final before saying an emotional farewell to england . 

hiddink , who has been temporary manager at chelsea for four months , is due to fly to moscow this week to resume his role as coach of the russian national team having made a big impact in west london . 

chelsea were in turmoil when he first arrived , having just sacked manager luiz felipe scolari following poor performances in the premier league and a highly- public falling out with star striker didier drogba . 

but drogba , left to train with the youth team by scolari , completed a remarkable turnaround in fortunes as he scored one of the goals in saturday 's 2-1 victory over everton in which lampard hit the winner . 

the result ended two years without a trophy for chelsea , who are hotly tipped to name ac milan 's carlo ancelotti as their next manager despite the popularity of hiddink who has always maintained his commitments with russia made it impossible to stay . 

lampard said : " some people think that 's bewildering but it 's not . 
it was always going to be until the end of the season so we understand . 
but he 's been absolutely fantastic to work with , every player will tell you that . 

" the way he works on the training ground , how simple he keeps football is something that is managerial genius . 
it 's been a pleasure to work with him . 

" it 's sad to say goodbye but he got a couple of gifts from us all on friday , just as a gesture . 
we all feel the same and feel very close to him . 
i do n't want to sound too romantic about it all but that 's true ! " 

hiddink has left such a big mark on the chelsea squad that many feel he will be a tough act to follow , even for a manager of such immense experience as ancelotti . 

lampard added : " i think that 's true but anyone who comes into a chelsea job knows it 's a huge job . 
success is what everyone craves here and quite rightly so with the squad and the investment that here . 

" so yes the new manager will have a hard act to follow but i 'm sure he will have credentials that will take the club forward . " 

drogba has more reason than most to be nervous of what the future holds at stamford bridge , especially as he is currently waiting to see what punishment he will receive after being charged by uefa for his behavior following the champions league semi-final against barcelona . 

but he was given a rousing reception by chelsea fans at the final whistle at and has yet to discuss his long-term future . 

" the fans have been supportive to me , " he insisted . 
" the only thing i have to worry about is what happened after that match . 
but i 'm delighted to finish the season the way we have . " 

drogba has been revitalised under hiddink and was impressive again at wembley as chelsea came back from conceding an opening goal to everton 's louis saha after just 25 seconds , the fastest goal in fa cup final history . 

it was drogba who headed chelsea level - his fifth goal in a major final for the club - before lampard 's wonderful left-foot strike arrowed into the net for the winner in the second half . 

drogba said : " it was a difficult start but you have to say it was a very good goal . 
but our strength is to believe in ourselves and our qualities and we played with more confidence . 
that 's why we won . " 

drogba also paid tribute to the effect hiddink has had on chelsea since he replaced scolari . 

he added : " i think the discipline between us was always good . 
you do n't win six or seven trophies in five years if you do n't have discipline in friendship . 
but the manger has given us an extra bit . "
