football : hiddink dances into the sunset with a message for chelsea

guus hiddink admitted chelsea 's riotous dance party after the fa cup final was the perfect way to end his brief reign , but the departing blues manager wants his side 's victory over everton to signal a more sedate period at stamford bridge . 

hiddink joined chelsea 's stars in a wild dressing room celebration at wembley on saturday , which saw even roman abramovich lose his inhibitions and throw a few shapes alongside michael essien , john obi mikel and company . 

a first trophy for two years does that kind of thing to a club who had grown used to such occasions during jose mourinho 's reign . 

but , while hiddink was delighted to savour every moment of a perfect farewell before resuming his role as russia coach on a full-time basis , the dutchman believes it is the mourinho era that abramovich must recreate if chelsea are to enjoy more champagne-soaked celebrations in the future . 

since mourinho was eased out after a bitter power struggle in september 2007 , chelsea have been through three managers and abramovich is set to appoint a fourth , most likely ac milan 's carlo ancelotti , in the next week . 

hiddink believes that constant change has had a negative effect on the players and he wants abramovich to stick with his new man for the good of the squad . 

" we had a nice dance party with everyone participating , the players and the staff , " hiddink said . 
" we have a multi-cultural squad and you must see the african players ; to see essien break-dance is a joy . 

" i did some good moves , the african way . 
at least that 's what i was thinking !

" roman danced with us . 
he is not a man of many words but he was in the middle of the party . 

" it was emotional in the dressing room because we were aiming for this cup . 

" we had this beautiful african dance , then i gathered the players and technical staff in another room because i wo n't get another opportunity now to speak to them . 

" i gave a five minute speech to thank them in a rather emotional way for the way we have worked together in the last four months . 

" now i think stability is a big need for the club . 
they have had too many changes in the past years and they recognise that themselves . 

" they need a long-term strategy so that they can build a team and keep up their high performance . 

" the players know what they are capable of . 
this victory might be the foundation for the future . 
they have shown they can do it . " 

after falling behind to louis saha 's 25 second opener , the fastest goal in fa cup final history , chelsea gradually overpowered everton . 

didier drogba equalised with a header from florent malouda 's cross in the 21st minute and frank lampard gave chelsea their fifth fa cup when he drove a long- range shot past tim howard after 72 minutes . 

hiddink refused to rule out managing another premier league club , or even chelsea , in the future , but for now he will visit his father before focusing on leading russia to the 2010 world cup finals . 

he will always have a place in the hearts of chelsea 's players and fans after one of the most successful caretaker manager spells of all-time . 

when hiddink replaced luiz felipe scolari in february he took over a squad in danger of stagnating , but his direct , open approach produced a run of just one defeat in his 22 matches . 

and were it not for some dubious decisions by referee tom henning ovrebo in the champions league semi-final second leg against barcelona , hiddink would have taken chelsea to two finals . 

he admitted that controversial defeat was the only disappointment of his time in england . 

" it would have been even more perfect if we had been somewhere a few days ago playing in another big final , " hiddink said . 

" that is the only regret i have . 
i would have loved to play man utd in the champions league final , but it did not happen . 

" i feel sadness to be leaving because the attitude from everyone was superb . 
on the other hand leaving with silverware gives a feeling of satisfaction . 

" this is the best way . 
you can say goodbye easier with a cup . "
