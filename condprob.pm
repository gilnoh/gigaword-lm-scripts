# The main module of this project. 
# a perl module that uses srilm_call.pm & octave_call.pm
# to calculate "conditional probability on LM over documents"
# this module is a restructured version of proto_condprob.pm 
# (hopefully final for the paper) 

# CONSIDER in the long term
# a. more modularity? 
# Conditional Probability part and "SOLR", "GigaWord" (or document 
# model stroing) specific parts are actually mixed up somewhat. 
# Maybe in future versions we should clearly separate them. 
# b. real "index-for-LM".
