Some scripts to run SRILM tools on gigaword, to calculate conditional probabilities of P(hypothesis|text). 

The scripts are perl scripts. Any late perl (later than 5.8) would do. The tools needed other than perl are: 

- SRILM 
- Octave 3.X (2.X wouldn't work) 

Developed and tested on SRILM 1.7 and Octave 3.6.2.
